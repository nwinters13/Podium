 What is it?
  -----------
  Podium is an application created to practice interviews. The application was
  created using the Microsoft Kinect. While practicing an interview, the Kinect
  will track the users body position and offer suggestions for improving their
  interviewing skills! After the interview, the user will rate themselves on 
  their skill, and the application will provide the user with a score based on
  how they performed in the interview.

  This application was originally designed to run alongside an iPad application
  created by Danielle Feerst and her team at Podium. The application was 
  designed to allow users to simulate an interview while using the application
  and rate themselves on their perceived performance. The Kinect application
  provides a quantitative score to go along with the qualitative self-rating.
