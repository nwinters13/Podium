 What is it?
  -----------
  Podium is an application created to practice interviews. The application was
  created using the Microsoft Kinect. While practicing an interview, the Kinect
  will provide feedback for the user and offer suggestions for improving their
  interviewing skills!

  This application was originally designed to run alongside an iPad application
  created by Danielle Feerst and her team at Podium. The application was 
  designed to allow users to simulate an interview while using the application
  and rate themselves on their perceived performance. The Kinect application
  provides a quantitative score to go along with the qualitative self-rating.

  Requirements
  ------------
  * Windows Computer
